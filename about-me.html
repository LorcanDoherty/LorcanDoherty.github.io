      <h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	<font size=+1> Hello! My name is Lorcan Doherty and I'm a third year student at <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie" target = "_blank"> NUIG </a>

	<br><br>
	I'm currently living in Galway to study although I'm originally from Gweedore, a rural parish in the hills of Donegal.
	<br>
	If I had to pick a favourtie hobbie I would probably say DJing.
    <br><br>
    From an early age I’ve retained a fond passion for music, so much so that I began to learn how to mix and make music in my early teens. I gradually developed my skills over time and to the point of running my own DJ business as well as producing electronic music to release on online platforms. Building a music brand and gigging live has given me invaluable experience regarding how to interact with people, social media promotion/marketing, content creation, and how to manage money. 
    I also have a fascination for computers in general and how they work.
    <br><br>
    My interest of both the arts and computing have peaked my curiosity in regards to studying the field in which both subjects overlap.
